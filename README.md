## File Description

- `Basic_Calculator.py`  
  This file contains the Python code for the calculator interface. It uses Tkinter to render the window, buttons, and display logic for evaluating basic arithmetic expressions.

---

## Features

- Graphical interface built with Tkinter
- Clickable buttons for numbers and operations
- Input field to show the current expression
- Evaluation of expressions using Pythonâ€™s built-in `eval()` function
- Error handling for invalid expressions
- Option to clear the input using a "C" button

---

## How It Works

1. Each button is mapped to a character (number or operator).
2. Button clicks are handled using a common event function.
3. On pressing "=", the current expression is evaluated.
4. If the expression is invalid, an error popup appears.
5. "C" clears the current input.

---

## Customization Tips

- To add new operations (e.g., square root, exponentiation), you can extend the button list and handle custom logic in the event handler.
- You can modify the button layout or style using Tkinter options such as font, color, padding, etc.

---

## Conclusion
This Basic Calculator project demonstrates how Python and Tkinter can be used to build simple yet functional GUI applications. By integrating button-driven input with real-time expression evaluation, the project serves as an excellent starting point for beginners to understand event handling, GUI layouts, and basic arithmetic logic in Python. It lays a solid foundation for developing more advanced tools such as scientific calculators or financial applications with expanded capabilities.

This tool is primarily designed for demonstration and learning purposes.

---

## Features

- Clean and interactive GUI using Tkinter
- User input for:
  - Number of years for the loan
  - Total loan amount
- EMI calculated using a simplified formula
- Displays a financial note: **"AVOID EMI"**
- Easy-to-understand and minimal design

---

## How to Run the Application

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arisudan/Python-.git
cd Python-
```

### Step 2: Run the Python Script

```bash
python EMI_Home _Loan.py
```

This will open a window with a button labeled **"EMI for home loan"**.

---

## How to Use

1. Click on **"EMI for home loan"** in the GUI.
2. Enter the **loan duration** in years when prompted.
3. Enter the **total loan amount** when prompted.
4. The program prints an approximate EMI value in the terminal along with the message: **"AVOID EMI"**.

---

## EMI Formula Used

```text
EMI = (Loan Amount / (Years * 12)) + 0.85 * (Loan Amount / (Years * 12))
```

Note: This is a simplified calculation and does not account for real-world interest rates.

---

## File Description

- `EMI_Home_Loan.py`  
  Main Python script containing the logic and interface code using Tkinter.

---

## Source Code: EMI_Home_Loan.py

```python
from tkinter.simpledialog import askinteger
from tkinter import *
from tkinter import messagebox

top = Tk()
top.geometry("200x200")

def show():
   num = askinteger("Input", "Enter no. of years")
   amt = askinteger("Input", "Enter total amount")
   print((amt / (num * 12)) + 0.85 * (amt / (num * 12)))
   print("AVOID EMI")

B = Button(top, text="EMI for home loan", command=show)
B.place(x=50, y=50)

top.mainloop()
```

---

## Notes

- Results are printed in the terminal. For better user experience, output can be redirected to the GUI using message boxes or text labels.
- The EMI formula used is intended for educational purposes only and does not reflect actual bank EMI calculations.

---

## Conclusion

The EMI Home Loan Calculator provides a simple and interactive way to estimate monthly loan installments using Python's Tkinter library. While the EMI formula used here is a basic approximation, this project effectively demonstrates the use of GUI components, user input handling, and arithmetic operations in a beginner-friendly environment. It serves as a foundational project for those looking to explore financial applications or build more advanced calculators with real-world formulas and GUI enhancements

# SIP Calculator GUI â€“ Python Tkinter

This project is a **Simple SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) Calculator** built using **Python's Tkinter** library. It helps users calculate their **total invested amount** and **maturity value** based on monthly investments, interest rate, and investment duration.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- User-friendly graphical interface using Tkinter  
- Calculates total invested amount and maturity value  
- Displays results in a popup message box  
- Input validation with error messages for invalid entries  

---

## ðŸ§° Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- `tkinter` (comes pre-installed with standard Python)

---

## ðŸ“¥ Installation on Windows


1. **Verify Installation**  
   Open Command Prompt and type:
   ```
   python --version
   ```

2. **Run the Script**  
   - Save the Python file as `sip_calculator.py`
   - Open a terminal or command prompt in that folder
   - Run:
     ```
     python sip_calculator.py
     ```

---

## How the Calculator Works

The calculator uses the standard **SIP maturity formula**:

```
Maturity Value = P Ã— ((1 + r)^n â€“ 1) / r) Ã— (1 + r)
```

Where:
- `P` = Monthly investment amount  
- `r` = Monthly interest rate = Annual Rate / 12 / 100  
- `n` = Total number of months = Years Ã— 12  

The total invested amount is calculated by:

```
Invested Amount = P Ã— n
```

---

## ðŸ§¾ Code Overview

```python
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import messagebox

def calculate_sip():
    try:
        monthly = float(entry_monthly.get())
        rate = float(entry_rate.get())
        years = int(entry_years.get())

        r = (rate / 100) / 12
        n = years * 12

        maturity = monthly * (((1 + r) ** n - 1) / r) * (1 + r)
        invested = monthly * n

        result = f"Total Invested: â‚¹{invested:.2f}\nMaturity Amount: â‚¹{maturity:.2f}"
        messagebox.showinfo("SIP Result", result)
    except:
        messagebox.showerror("Error", "Please enter valid numbers.")

root = tk.Tk()
root.title("SIP Calculator")
root.geometry("300x300")

tk.Label(root, text="Monthly Investment (â‚¹)").pack()
entry_monthly = tk.Entry(root)
entry_monthly.pack()

tk.Label(root, text="Annual Interest Rate (%)").pack()
entry_rate = tk.Entry(root)
entry_rate.pack()

tk.Label(root, text="Duration (Years)").pack()
entry_years = tk.Entry(root)
entry_years.pack()

tk.Button(root, text="Calculate SIP", command=calculate_sip).pack()

root.mainloop()
```

---

## Output Example

If you input:

- Monthly Investment: â‚¹2000  
- Annual Interest Rate: 12  
- Duration: 5 years  

The output will be something like:
```
Total Invested: â‚¹120000.00
Maturity Amount: â‚¹162938.27
```

---

## Conclusion
