# GUI Calculator Projects Using Python and Tkinter

This repository contains beginner-friendly projects that demonstrate how to create basic graphical user interfaces using Python and the Tkinter library. The primary focus is on building a functional calculator that allows users to perform arithmetic operations using button inputs.

## Installation Guide

### 1. Installing Python on Windows

To get started, make sure Python is installed on your system.

1. Visit the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Download the latest version suitable for your Windows system.
3. Run the installer and ensure you check the box labeled "Add Python to PATH".
4. Click "Install Now" and follow the installation steps.

To confirm installation, open Command Prompt and type:

```bash
python --version
```

If installed correctly, the installed version number will be displayed.

## Project Overview

The project demonstrates how to:

- Create buttons dynamically using Tkinter
- Capture button click events
- Perform expression evaluation
- Display the result or clear the screen as needed

This is a great starting point for anyone new to Python GUI development.

## Running the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository

To download the project files, use the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gui-calculator-python.git
cd gui-calculator-python
```

Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.

### 2. Run the Calculator Application

Make sure you're in the project directory, then run:

```bash
python simple_calculator.py
```

This will open a basic calculator window where you can perform operations using the on-screen buttons.

---

## File Description

- `simple_calculator.py`  
  This file contains the Python code for the calculator interface. It uses Tkinter to render the window, buttons, and display logic for evaluating basic arithmetic expressions.

---

## Features

- Graphical interface built with Tkinter
- Clickable buttons for numbers and operations
- Input field to show the current expression
- Evaluation of expressions using Python’s built-in `eval()` function
- Error handling for invalid expressions
- Option to clear the input using a "C" button

---

## How It Works

1. Each button is mapped to a character (number or operator).
2. Button clicks are handled using a common event function.
3. On pressing "=", the current expression is evaluated.
4. If the expression is invalid, an error popup appears.
5. "C" clears the current input.

---

## Customization Tips

- To add new operations (e.g., square root, exponentiation), you can extend the button list and handle custom logic in the event handler.
- You can modify the button layout or style using Tkinter options such as font, color, padding, etc.
